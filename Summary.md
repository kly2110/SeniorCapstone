Objective:
The objective of this project with Pinnacle Construction and Development Group was for our team to document Pinnacle’s core processes of Business Development, Human Resources, and Operations while developing recommendations to help Pinnacle improve accountability, efficiency, and communication between departments.

## Scope
The scope of the project was to determine all of the major processes that take place within Business Development, Human Resources, and Operations and to document these processes. The ultimate goal for Pinnacle will be to have process documentation for all of their core processes within their seven departments.

## Methodology
In order to complete this project, our Action Learning team was split into two groups. Three of us interviewed the Human Resources and Operations, while the other two interviewed Business Development. After initial interviews, we put together our findings and looked for gaps in our knowledge of the processes. At this point, we went back for second interviews or further interviewed within that department. This allowed us to build flow diagrams of each department, which were then supported by detailed information on each process flow. This detailed information ultimately allowed us to develop process flow documentation for each of the core processes.

## Major Findings
Our major findings were mainly within the three departments that we focused on,
Business Development, Human Resources, and Operations. However, some of our findings were interdepartmental as well. Our general findings were that Pinnacle Construction has a lot of well-established employees with a lot of “tribal knowledge” of how systems and processes work at Pinnacle. Due to this, there is currently a lack of standardization and process documentation that reflects all of this knowledge. This can make it hard for new employees to join the Pinnacle team. Additionally, we found that there isn’t a set way that communications flow between departments.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
After interviewing and looking into Pinnacle’s core processes, it was made clear that one of the main things that Pinnacle could benefit from would be standardization materials as well as process flow documents. By using the “tribal knowledge” that many employees have in order to make detailed, step-by-step materials for different job processes, it has the potential to drastically improve the ease at which new employees can learn how to do things and become integrated at Pinnacle. Additionally, by standardizing processes, it will allow departments to have a more clear idea of how they can communicate and gain information from other departments.
